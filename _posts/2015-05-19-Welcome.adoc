# Welcome

ARC is a competition styled after FRC. As a general principle, we aim to follow a relaxed rulset, but instead all competitors are limited by the equally available power from the battery. The focus will be on letting competitors define strategy and to allow them the freedom to solve their goals however they see fit. For those less experienced in robotics, we will provide a list of suggested parts and components to aid in getting started. Weâ€™ve aimed for competitors to build a drivable robot for $1000 while requiring only minimal hand tools and experience.


Over the next couple of days we'll be publishing the list of control system parts on our https://github.com/arc-robotics/arc-robotics.github.io/wiki[wiki] as well as game rules. The competition is developing very rapidly, stay tuned for updates on the kit of parts and competiton rules.
